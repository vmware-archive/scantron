  scantron --nmap-results results.xml --inventory inventory.yml

== generating nmap scan results file

    nmap -oX results.xml 10.0.0.1-6

== inventory file

The different pieces of information required to run this tool are in a number
of different places that are non-trivial to fetch and for a machine to join.
I've punted on the problem for now and required a YAML file that contains a
list of hosts in the following format.

    hosts:
    - name: cell
      username: user
      password: secret
      addresses:
      - 10.0.0.1
      - 10.0.0.2
      - 10.0.0.3

    - name: brain
      username: user
      password: secretz
      addresses:
      - 10.0.0.4
      - 10.0.0.5
      - 10.0.0.6

In the future it would be nice to automate either the creation of this file or
the fetching of this information directly.
